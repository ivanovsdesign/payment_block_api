| clientTypeName| VARCHAR(50)  | Unique client type name      |

### 2. BlockingReasons
Stores the reasons for blocking transactions.

| Column          | Type         | Description                       |

### 4. TransactionBlocks
Stores information about transaction blocks.

| Column      | Type        | Description                             |
