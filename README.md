# üö´ Payment Blocking API

This API allows you to manage transaction blocks for payment delivery to businesses, ensuring secure and fraud-free transactions. 

`payment_block.yaml` contains OpenAPI specs for payment blocking feature
`database/schema.sql` contains script for [database schema](#-database-schema)

<i><b>Notice</b>: it is just an OpenAPI specification made as an assignment<br>Acual service isn't developed yet</i>

## üìù Overview

This API provides functionalities to:
1. **Block transactions** for a particular client.
2. **Unlock transactions** for a particular client.
3. **Check if a client is blocked**.
4. **Distinguish fraudsters** from ordinary clients.

## üóÑ Database Schema

### Overview

This schema supports the functionality required for blocking and unblocking transactions for clients based on various reasons. It consists of tables for managing clients, client types, transaction blocks, and blocking reasons.

### Tables

#### 1. ClientTypes
Stores the types of clients.

| Column        | Type         | Description                  |
|---------------|--------------|------------------------------|
| clientTypeId  | INT          | Primary key, auto-increment  |
| clientTypeName| VARCHAR(50)  | Unique client type name      |

#### 2. BlockingReasons
Stores the reasons for blocking transactions.

| Column          | Type         | Description                       |
|-----------------|--------------|-----------------------------------|
| reasonId        | INT          | Primary key, auto-increment       |
| reasonDescription | VARCHAR(255)| Unique reason description         |

#### 3. Clients
Stores the client information.

| Column        | Type         | Description                             |
|---------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------|
| clientId      | INT          | Primary key, auto-increment             |
| clientTypeId  | INT          | Foreign key referencing ClientTypes     |

#### 4. TransactionBlocks
Stores information about transaction blocks.

| Column      | Type        | Description                             |

#### Relationships

- `Clients.clientTypeId` ‚Üí `ClientTypes.clientTypeId`
- `TransactionBlocks.clientId` ‚Üí `Clients.clientId`
- `TransactionBlocks.reasonId` ‚Üí `BlockingReasons.reasonId`

### Example Queries

#### Block a Client
```sql
INSERT INTO transaction_blocking.TransactionBlocks (clientId, isBlocked, reasonId)
VALUES (1, TRUE, (SELECT reasonId FROM transaction_blocking.BlockingReasons WHERE reasonDescription = 'Fraudulent activity detected'));
```

#### Unblock a Client
```sql
UPDATE transaction_blocking.TransactionBlocks
SET isBlocked = FALSE
WHERE clientId = 1 AND isBlocked = TRUE;
```

#### Check if a Client is Blocked
```sql
SELECT isBlocked, (SELECT reasonDescription FROM transaction_blocking.BlockingReasons WHERE reasonId = tb.reasonId) AS reason, blockedAt
FROM transaction_blocking.TransactionBlocks tb
WHERE clientId = 1
ORDER BY blockedAt DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

#### Distinguish Client Type
```sql
SELECT (SELECT clientTypeName FROM transaction_blocking.ClientTypes WHERE clientTypeId = c.clientTypeId) AS clientType
FROM transaction_blocking.Clients c
WHERE clientId = 1;
```

### Example Scenarios
**Scenario 1: Transaction Blocked Due to Fraudulent Activity**
Transaction Attempt: Client with clientId = 1 attempts a transaction.
Fraud Detection: System detects suspicious activity and flags it as potentially fraudulent.

#### Block Transaction:
```sql
INSERT INTO transaction_blocking.TransactionBlocks (clientId, isBlocked, reasonId)
VALUES (1, TRUE, (SELECT reasonId FROM transaction_blocking.BlockingReasons WHERE reasonDescription = 'Fraudulent activity detected'));
```

**Scenario 2: Unblocking After Security Check**
Security Check: After a manual review, the client is cleared of fraudulent activity.

#### Unblock Client:

```sql
UPDATE transaction_blocking.TransactionBlocks
SET isBlocked = FALSE
WHERE clientId = 1 AND isBlocked = TRUE;
```

**Scenario 3: Transaction Blocked Due to Invalid Credentials**
Transaction Attempt: Client with clientId = 2 attempts a transaction.
Credential Check: Client provides invalid credentials, and the transaction is rejected by the bank.

#### Block Transaction:
```sql
INSERT INTO transaction_blocking.TransactionBlocks (clientId, isBlocked, reasonId)
VALUES (2, TRUE, (SELECT reasonId FROM transaction_blocking.BlockingReasons WHERE reasonDescription = 'Invalid credentials'));
```
